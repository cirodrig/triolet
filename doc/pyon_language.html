<p>This document describes the syntax, data types, and functions supported in Pyon source code.</p>

<h1>Syntax and semantics</h1>

<p>Pyon is based on Python 3 for reasons of programmer familiarity.
Python syntax is used whenever possible, in a way that usually does
what a Python programmer would expect.  Internally, Pyon is similar to
ML.  The user-level differences from Python 3 are described here.</p>

<p>At the top level, a Pyon file consists of a sequence of function
definitions and export statements.  (Export statements are described
below.)  These may occur in any order.</p>

<h2>Statements</h2>

<p>In function bodies, Pyon supports 'if' and 'return' statements,
assignment statements, expression statements, and function
definitions.  Other statements are not permitted.</p>

<p>Pyon source code may imperatively define and update local
variables.  The code is internally translated to functional code,
using the static single assignment transformation.  The translation
has several implications for programmers.  One effect is that every
variable must be defined before it is used on any code path.  A group
of function definitions without other intervening statements may
reference each other, allowing mutually recursive functions to be
defined.</p>

<p>Variable values are resolved at different times in Pyon versus
standard Python.  Wen a local function uses a variable that is defined
in an enclosing scope, it will observe the value at the time that the
function is <i>defined</i>.  This is different from the behavior of
Python code, which will observe the value at the time the function
is <i>used</i>.  The following example illustrates the difference:</p>

<pre>
def foo(x):
  y = 1
  def bar(z): return y + z
  y = 2
  return bar(x)
</pre>

<p>In Python, the call <code>foo(100)</code> returns 102.  In Pyon, the call returns 101.</p>

<h2>Typing</h2>

<p>Pyon is statically typed using Hindley-Milner type inference with
type class constraints.  Type inference is performed after SSA, so
that different SSA variables may have different types even if they
were derived from the same variable in the source code.</p>

<p>Pyon supports optional type signatures on function parameters and
returns, using Python 3 annotation syntax.  Two changes are made to
Python syntax to support type signatures.  First, <code>-&gt;</code>
is an infix operator that is only valid when used inside parameter and
return annotations.  Second, the <code>@forall</code> decorator may be
used for explicit quantification.  When used to decorate a function
definition, it takes a list of variable names as arguments and
introduces new type variables with those names.  Because it defines
variables, "forall" does not follow Python's variable scoping rules.
Type signatures use Python's expression syntax, but have different
semantics.  There is currently no way to explicitly declare type class
constraints in type signatures.</p>

<p>Type signatures consist of:</p>
<ul>
 <li>References to variables or constants.</li>
 <li>Function calls, denoting type application. Example: <code>list(int)</code></li>
 <li>Tuple expressions, denoting tuple types.  Example: <code>(float, float, float)</code></li>
 <li>Arrow expressions, denoting function types.  If a function takes
 multiple parameters, the parameter types are multiplied together.
 Example: <code>int * int -> int</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Expressions</h2>

<p>An expression that may define a variable, such as the destination
of an assignment or the part of a list comprehension between the
keywords "for" and "in", is called a "target".  Tuple targets and
variable targets are supported.  Only tuples with 2, 3, and 4 elements
are supported.  Array subscript targets are not supported.</p>

<p>Unary negation is supported.</p>

<p>The following binary operators are supported:
<code>or and < <= > >= != == + - * / // % **</code></p>

<p>Integer and floating-point literals, variable expressions, array
subscripting, tuple construction, function calls, lambda expressions,
conditional expressions, list comprehensions, and generators are
supported.  Array subscripting only works on lists.  Generators may
contain any number of "for" and "if" clauses following the initial,
required "for" clause.  List comprehensions behave the same as
generators (this is expected to change in future revisions).  Tuple
construction is supported only for tuples with 2, 3, and 4
elements.</p>

<p>Function definitions and function calls support positional arguments only.</p>

<h2>Export statements</h2>

<p>Functions are exported using the following syntax.  STRING stands
for a string.  IDENTIFIER stands for a Pyon identifier.  TYPE stands
for a Pyon type.</p>

<pre>
export ccall STRING IDENTIFIER : TYPE
</pre>

<pre>
export ccall IDENTIFIER : TYPE
</pre>

<p>The optional string is the name used to reference the function in
C.  If not given, it defaults to the Pyon name.  The identifier is the
name of the function to be exported.  The type is the exported type.
Exported types may contain ints, floats, lists, and functions.  Tuple
types are not supported in exported function parameters or returns,
however, lists of tuples are allowed.  Some uses of function types are
not supported.</p>

<p>A function may be exported multiple times with different names.
This is useful for polymorphic functions that are used with different
types.</p>

<h1>Predefined types</h1>

<p>The supported data types and values are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>NoneType, which has the single value None</li>
 <li>bool, which has the two values True and False</li>
 <li>Tuples of 2, 3, and 4 elements</li>
 <li>The numeric types "int" and "float"</li>
 <li>Function types</li>
 <li>The "list" type constructor.  It takes one parameter, the type of the list's members.  A list consists of an array and a nonnegative integer holding the array size.  All array elements have the same type.</li>
 <li>The "stream" type constructor.  It takes two parameters.  The first is the shape of the stream, which is the container type that the stream corresponds to (see the type of __iter__).  The second is the type of the stream's elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stream shapes are not useful to users with the current feature set.
Stream shapes may be useful in the future, if support is added for
arrays of statically known size.  Stream shapes are used internally to
label streams with shape information.</p>

<h1>Predefined Functions</h1>

<p>Each function listed below is shown with its name, type signature,
and a description.  In the type signatures below, single-letter names
are used to denote type variables and other names are used to denote
constants.  Type class constraints are given in Haskell syntax.</p>

</p>

<p>
<code>map : Traversable t => (a -> b) * t(a) -> t(b)</code><br>

Apply a function to all elements of a container.</p>

<p>
<code>reduce : Traversable t => (a * a -> a) * a * t(a) -> a</code><br>

Compute a reduction over all elements of a container.
The reduction function is assumed to be be associative.
The initial value is assumed to be an identity of the reduction function.</p>

<p>
<code>reduce1 : Traversable t => (a * a -> a) * t(a) -> a</code><br>

function is assumed to be associative.  The container should be
