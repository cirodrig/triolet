Use the same alignment for all PAP arguments.  Currently, the actual alignment
of the first argument depends on the maximum alignment of all arguments.  This
would require walking the entire argument tag list once before visiting any
PAP fields.  Instead, let's just have one alignment rule.  This way, we can
also avoid a modulus operation at every step.

  Do something about the incomplete support for parametric record types.
  Either remove parametric records, or fully support them.  Fully supporting
  parametric records entails generating instructions to compute size,
  alignment, and offsets at runtime.
