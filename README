Building
--------

We don't have a configure script yet.  Instead, edit the flags in 'mk/flags.mk'
to suit your system.

The code supports building in a separate build tree.  Start with a clean copy
of the source tree.  Create a new, empty directory that will contain the build
tree.  Change to that directory and run 'lndir' with the source tree path as
its parameter.  This will create a directory tree with symbolic links to your
source tree.  Then run 'make' in the build directory.

Using
-----

After building, some environment variables need to be set up.
Add the 'bin' subdirectory to PATH.
Add the 'src/compiler' subdirectory to PYTHONPATH.

At this point, you can import and run compiler modules from the Python
interpreter.
