Building
--------

We don't have a configure script yet.  Instead, edit the flags in 'mk/flags.mk'
to suit your system.

The code supports building in a separate build tree.  Start with a clean copy
of the source tree.  Create a new, empty directory that will contain the build
tree.  Change to that directory and run 'lndir' with the source tree path as
its parameter.  This will create a directory tree with symbolic links to your
source tree.  Then run 'make' in the build directory.

Hacking
