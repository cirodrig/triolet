Building
--------

We don't have a configure script yet.  Instead, edit the flags in 'Makefile'
to suit your system.  After building, run 'python setup.py install'.  You may
supply a prefix to this command to change the install path.

Using
-----

After building, some environment variables need to be set up.
Add the 'bin' subdirectory to PATH.
Ensure the installed python modules are in the python search path.  You may
need to add the directory containing the Python 'pyon' package to PYTHONPATH.

At this point, you can import and run compiler modules from pyon.

Hacking
