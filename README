Building
--------

This package uses autoconf and make.  The typical build process is

autoconf
./configure --prefix=$PWD/rt
make
make install

Using
-----

After building, some environment variables need to be set up.
Add the 'bin' subdirectory of the install path to PATH.
Ensure the installed python modules are in the python search path.  You may
need to add the directory containing the Python 'pyon' package to PYTHONPATH.

At this point, you can import and run compiler modules from pyon.
The script 'pyon_testsuite' runs the test suite.

Hacking
