Triolet is a high-level programming language designed to allow software
developers to write compute-intensive loops in a clear, concise style while
still getting the performance you would expect from carefully written C code.
As a research project, Triolet is being used to explore language and compiler
design issues at the intersection of high-level languages and high-performance
parallel algorithms.  This is an early release of Triolet; expect some bugs
and performance issues.
