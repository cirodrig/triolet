Python Coding Conventions
------------------------

Python is quite permissive at the source code level, which makes it
easy for errors to remain undetected in the code base.  To reduce the
incidence of errors, please adhere to the following coding conventions.

* Visual style

  * Use documentation strings and comments to explain your code.

  * Organize function bodies into paragraphs separated by a blank
    line.  Organize large files into sections, separated by a row of
    octothorpes.  In general, if you have more than four things,
    consider organizing them into meaningful groups, as I did when
    writing this file.

  * Naming conventions:

    + Data types:                   CamelCase
    + Modules:                      lowercase_with_underscores
    + Local variables and functions: lowercase_with_underscores

    + Public methods and members:   camelCase
    + Public global variables:      camelCase
    + Public global functions:      camelCase
    + Public constants:             UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES

    + Internal global variables:    _camelCase
    + Internal methods and members: _camelCase
    + Internal constants:           _UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES

* Error checking and ambiguity

  * Do not nest unspecialized data types to a depth of three or more.
    For example, do not use a list of tuples of lists of expressions.
    Instead, create a data type with a meaningful name.

  * Do not allow variables to hold multiple incompatible types.  In
    particular, don't overload functions to work for different kinds of
    unspecialized data types, such as lists, tuples, or dictionaries.
    For example, do not write a function that accepts either an
    'Expression' or a list of 'Expression'.  Special-casing 'None' is
    acceptable.  Creating data types specifically for the purpose of
    overloading on them is acceptable.

  * Check the values stored into global variables and the fields of
    globally used data types.
    
* Extensibility

  * Data structures shared by many modules should not contain members
    or methods that are only meaningful to one module.  If you want to
    add module-specific members to a data structure, then add one member,
    whose name matches the module's name.  It should be an instance
    of a class defined in your module.  It should be safe to delete the
    member when your module is finished.
